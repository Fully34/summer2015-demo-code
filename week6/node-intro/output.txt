Node is a javascript runtime - it's another environment where javascript can run

Not in a browser, no window, and no DOM.
No browser-based security restrictions - node.js can access the filesystem, hardware, and network.

There isn't one global scope. Each file has its own scope. We REQUIRE our MODULES into other MODULES.

node REPL - read, eval, print, loop

console.log from a node.js file shows up in terminal.
